/// DLT_NULL BSD loopback encapsulation; the link layer header is a 4-byte field, in host byte order, containing a value of 2 for IPv4 packets, a value of either 24, 28, or 30 for IPv6 packets, a value of 7 for OSI packets, or a value of 23 for IPX packets. All of the IPv6 values correspond to IPv6 packets; code reading files should check for all of them. Note that ``host byte order'' is the byte order of the machine on which the packets are captured; if a live capture is being done, ``host byte order'' is the byte order of the machine capturing the packets, but if a ``savefile'' is being read, the byte order is not necessarily that of the machine reading the capture file.
